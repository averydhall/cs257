Avery Hall and Anders Shenholm
HOOPDATA website draft

Notes for grader (11/11/21 deadline)

- When testing the Rosters and Rankings pages, it might be easiest to get data by
  using a current team's abbreviation and a recent year, since many teams listed
  only existed for some period in the past. Here are a few combinations that are
  sure to return a valid table on both pages, provided for ease of testing:
    1. CHI, 1996
    2. LAL, 2002
    3. GSW, 2015

- When using the Player Info info, note that in rare cases, players included in
  the database do not have data as a result of never playing but still occupying
  a roster spot
