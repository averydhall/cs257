DATA: basketball stats and player info between 1950-2017

FEATURES CURRENTLY WORKING:
- Player info search
- Roster search by team and year
- Player statistical rankings by team and year

FEATURES NOT YET WORKING:
- No source for player photos yet
- Team abbreviations listed in the Player Info result tables are formatted with
  clickable hypertext but lead nowhere as of yet (will eventually link to
  appropriate Team Roster results pages)


ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- When testing the Team Rosters and Player Rankings pages, several teams listed only
  existed for some period in the past. Here are a few sample combinations that are
  sure to return a valid table on both pages, provided for ease of testing:
    1. CHI, 1996
    2. LAL, 2002
    3. GSW, 2015

- When using the Player Info page, note that in rare cases, players included in
  the database do not have data as a result of never playing but still occupying
  a roster spot

- Most features from the unimplemented "Advanced Search" page mockup have been
  newly integrated into "Player Info", so we have decided not to implement the
  former)
